#
# PURPOSE:
#     To have a command line flash card tool with minimal code, plain text input and output
#
# VISION:
#     The goal i have for this script is a basic level emulation of ANKI to where i have a way to
#     keep track of a score for each item in each selected deck so that it can pick from a selection
#     of the lowest scoring items and shuf them to the user for reenforcement of active recall.
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#     fzf - https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
#     bat - https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

\t${YELLOW}\$XDG_DATA_HOME/flash${NC}
OR
\t${YELLOW}~/.local/share/flash${NC} for Linux
\t${YELLOW}~/Library/Application Support/flash${NC} for mac
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
${LCYAN}Exiting:${NC}\n
\tYou can exit the application at any time by pressing either ${RED}q${NC} or ${RED}Q${NC}

${LCYAN}Usage:${NC}\n
\tYou will first be prompted with a question and will need to press ${RED}[Enter]${NC}
\tto reveal the answer. Once the answer is revealed you will need to either
\tquit, or give a rating to how difficult the question was.

${LCYAN}The Scoring System:${NC}\n
\tThe last field in the ${YELLOW}.csv${NC} files is the current point score of the 'card'
\tEvery time you rate a card the point score will either increase, decrease,
\tor stay the same. zero is the lowest value, and the upper limit is over
\t100 billion.

\t${CYAN}Scoring Results:${NC}
\t\t[${LRED}Hard${NC}]\t\t-2 points
\t\t[${RED}Difficult${NC}]\t-1 point
\t\t[${YELLOW}Normal${NC}]\tNo Change
\t\t[${GREEN}Mild${NC}]\t\t+1 point
\t\t[${LGREEN}Easy${NC}]\t\t+2 points

\tThe cards with the lowest scores (you scored them as ${LRED}Hard${NC}/${RED}Difficult${NC}) are
\tsorted to the top, a pool of them are picked and from that pool 1 card is
\trandomly drawn. As you become more familair with the material and rate it
\tas easier, the point values will go up and the cards will appear less
\tfrequently making room for those cards that are still difficult and have
\tlower point values.

    It is a good idea to start all cards off at ${YELLOW}0${NC} initially so that they all
    have an equal chance of being drawn initially.
